I am an Aerospace Engineer interested in space and robots ... `SPACE ROBOTS`!!! My work and research interests span the field of `guidnace, navigation and control (GNC)`. I work primarily on learning-based control within fields of `reinforcement learning` and `adaptive control`, optimal control within `chance-constrained optimal control` and, in technical practice, `robotics software and design` -- where I've crafted both autonomous ground and aerial robotics.
